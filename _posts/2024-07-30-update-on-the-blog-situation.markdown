How about this—to make this a real honest-to-Goodness blog,
I will make a log entry, on the web. A web log, if you will.

I am currently:
* Working on a stressful project at work.
* Being a parent. (Fun but tiring!)
* In pain because I tweaked my shoulder reaching for the nightstand??
* Old.
* Looking for houses during a heat wave—tiring, but I do love
  to imagine spending vast sums of money, so it's not all bad.

I'm also taking mind-altering substances for the first time in my
life, and this bullet point grew too large so now it's a paragraph.
Specifically, I am taking Wellbutrin/bupropion—I guess it's an
anti-depressant. No, I'm not depressed. Doc thinks maybe
I have ADHD, but this is easier/safer than Adderall, so
we're trying this first as a way to fix insufficient serotonin
uptake, which might help with motivation. I haven't noticed anything
so far except my tolerance of coffee has gone down (which, yes, does
suck).

The concept that I might have a clinical diagnosis to explain my
lifelong inability to motivate myself to do boring but important
things (like homework) feels like...my heart is lighter, I guess.
I'm hopeful. Less ashamed. Actually, I'm excited. I'm daydreaming about
being on Adderall and suddenly being productive—suddenly being able
to finish projects that I start, and focus my energy on the things
I know I should be doing. I would be......unstoppable. At least, [in
my mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT_4YytbF-w). Look, I'm so
optimistic, I'm even writing a !@#$ing blog post pouring out my guts
about an extremely personal topic as if I won't be cringing at myself
in less than a week.

Well, here's to hoping.
