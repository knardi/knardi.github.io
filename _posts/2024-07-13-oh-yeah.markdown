You think you know me, Yesterday Kevin? You don't know me. If I want
to blog, I will. This blog entry is specifically here to remind you
that you cannot and will not control me with your spectral hands
reaching out to puppet me from the past. You are merely intended cause,
but I am Effect, Will, Purpose, and no man, not even me, controls me.

I don't know what I'm doing.
